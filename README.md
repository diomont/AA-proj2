# Aprendizagem Automática - Project 2
## Anomaly Detection for Predictive Maintenance

Second project for the Aprendizagem Automática course.

Dataset used: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/AI4I+2020+Predictive+Maintenance+Dataset

The jupyter notebook `training.ipynb` details the process used, including data visualization and pre-processing, model training and testing.

The python script `undersampling_loop.py` runs the undersampling, data splitting, training and testing several times and writes the results to a text file to assess the efficacy of the models with different undersampled datasets.
